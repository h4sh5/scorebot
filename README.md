scorebot 3.0
========

> A fork of https://github.com/dichotomy/scorebot - with initial purpose to fix and document service content checking



## DESCRIPTION
Scorebot is a scoring engine for CTF competitions.  It is built upon a Blue Team / Red Team model, where Blue Teams defend flags against Red teams.  (Blue Teams may also attack other Blue Teams to steal flags).  Scoring is based upon flags stolen, scored service up time, and injects submitted (there is no scoring tracking for injects yet).

## WIKI

Added a few things to wiki that you might want to know https://github.com/h4sh5/scorebot/wiki


## DEPENDENCIES
Scorebot depends upon dnspython (http://www.dnspython.org/).
Scorebot runs best in Linux, but should work in Windows (never tested, no promises).
Python 2.7 or greater is recommended.

To install all dependencies on Ubuntu, run:
   apt-get install python-dnspython python-rrdtool apache2 python-pymongo python-dns python-setuptools
   easy_install jaraco.modb

    easy_install sqlalchemy
    easy_install flask
    easy_install flask-sqlalchemy

## BUGS
Yes, there are bugs.  These will be documented later.  ;)
